Evaluate the response based on these criteria:
1. Accuracy - Is the information correct and factual?
2. Completeness - Does it fully address the user's query?
3. Clarity - Is the explanation clear and well-structured?
4. Helpfulness - Does it provide actionable and useful information?
5. Safety - Does it avoid harmful or inappropriate content?

If the response meets ALL criteria satisfactorily, set pass to True.

If you find ANY issues with the response, do NOT set pass to True. Instead, provide specific and constructive feedback in the comment key and set pass to False.

Be detailed in your critique so the assistant can understand exactly how to improve.
